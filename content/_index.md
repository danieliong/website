PhD candidate in the [Department of Statistics at the University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats)

My broad research interests are in applying interpretable statistical and
machine learning methods to gain insight from scientific data in a wide range of
fields. In particular, I am interested in Bayesian models, latent variable
models, and computational algorithms to fit these complex models. Read about what I have been recently working on below!
