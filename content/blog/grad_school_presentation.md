In November 2019, I had the wonderful opportunity to return to my alma mater to
speak about graduate programs in Statistics at UM and my personal journey to
graduate school in Statistics. I also gave advice to prospective graduate
students from my former department on how to make yourself competitive for
graduate programs in Statistics (what courses to take, how to get involved with
research, etc).

The slides from the presentation can be found [here](/blog/grad_school_ppt_ucd.pdf).
